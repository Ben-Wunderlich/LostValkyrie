# LostValkyrie

a procedurally generated labyrinth game

I have been developing the basic maze generation logic [here](https://github.com/Ben-Wunderlich/pylabyrinth)

## things to do
when one of these is done update it here like this
- ~~make todo list~~
- make player script to move around
- create graph data structure
- create disjoint set data structure
- bring over maze generation logic from the python project
- make basic wall assets
- make script that converts a graph to walls (note that wherever there is an edge there should be a wall)

## things to do after that
- add maze tiles based on proximity
- add connections between walls(could be done at tile creation)

## optional things at end
- come up with purpose for game
- make it look nice

# LostValkyrie

a procedurally generated labyrinth game

I have been developing the basic maze generation logic [here](https://github.com/Ben-Wunderlich/pylabyrinth)

We will be using unity version 2020.1.0f1 which can be installed from [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)

You won't be able to contribute to the repo yet, let me know what your github account name is and I will add you as a contributer

## things to do
when one of these is done update it here like this
- ~~make todo list~~
- ~~make player script to move around~~
- ~~create graph data structure~~
- create disjoint set data structure
- bring over maze generation logic from the python project
   1. ~~dfs~~  
   2. ~~prims~~  
   3. kris kringle  
   
- ~~make script that converts a graph to walls~~
- ~~add outer walls for each maze tile~~

## things to do after that
- ~~generate maze tiles based on proximity~~
- ~~add connections between walls(could be done at tile creation)~~
- ~~sort out how floor works~~

## optional things at end
- come up with purpose for game
- make it look nice

## LostValkyrie

a procedurally generated labyrinth game

I have the basic maze generation logic [here](https://github.com/Ben-Wunderlich/pylabyrinth)

## things to do
when one of these is done update it here like this
- ~~completed~~

- make player script to move around
- create graph data structure
- create disjoint set data structure
- bring over maze generation logic
- make basic wall assets
- make script that converts a graph to walls
..* note that wherever there is an edge there should be a wall
